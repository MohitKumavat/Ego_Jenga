# Ego-Jenga
"Ego-Jenga"
**Egocentric vision** to experience human vision in the virtual world for better interaction using VR system, by creating Jenga game in **Unity3D engine** which helps to view and play more precisely.

**OculusVR headset** is used to interact with the virtual world. I have created a room with one wall as a mirror reflecting the objects in the room. The game is basically of 3 levels, in each level, a player needs to achieve a maximum score on the scoreboard to go to the next level, and if fails to achieve the level score by dropping any of the Jenga cubes on the floor, the game will restart from the first level. Cubes when touched get highlighted.

**Level 1:** Jenga tower with 3 stacks (9 cubes), scoreboard with max 5 points. The score will increase as you safely remove and place the Jenga cube on top of the tower, the lowest stack of the tower has more points (same as the stack numbered from above) and get decreasing as you go upward.

**Level 2:** Jenga tower with 5 stacks (15 cubes), scoreboard with max 10 points.
**Level 3:** Jenga tower with 7 stacks (21 cubes), scoreboard with max 20 points.
